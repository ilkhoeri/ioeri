The Svg element is a container that defines a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document with added some utility properties.

Svg will be very useful for you when you want to use a more specific `<LogoIcon/>` in an application.

We added several utility properties to make it easier for you in development, such as size ratio, fill property adjustment, stroke and several others.
